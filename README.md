Genetic Task Scheduling
=======================

Scheduling multiprocessor tasks with genetic algorithms.


## Goal

The goal of this student project was to resolve multiprocessor tasks scheduling problem using genetic algorithms. According to the task two python scripts have been created:

* gen_data.py - used for random dataset generation
* gentasche.py - used for performing evolution against given dataset.


## How to use

Use commands

    ./gen_data.py --help
    
and

    ./gentasche.py --help
    
to get help on proper using those scripts.
